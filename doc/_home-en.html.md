## About Artsdata

### Vision

Build a knowledge graph that is open, accessible and community sourced. Under the stewardship of stakeholders from a diversity of organizations, Artsdata.ca is uniquely focused on the Canadian arts sector. The objectives are to:

- Create an essential digital resource that reflects the values of the arts
- Build a substantial web of linked open data of arts-related information
- Provide high-quality data that is comprehensive and up to date

### Benefits

The Artsdata.ca knowledge graph enables the arts sector to:

- Gain knowledge, agency and control of descriptive metadata about events, persons, organizations and venues
- Streamline the circulation of arts events to listings sites, recommenders and other search engines by programmatically sharing event metadata
- Optimize the use of the latest web technologies to generate new opportunities

### Activities

- Promote a common data model for cultural information about the performing arts, taking advantage of existing ontologies where possible
- Onboard cohorts of Canadian arts organizations to include their descriptive metadata in Artsdata.ca
- Increase the breadth and quality of the Artsdata.ca knowledge graph by adding data from a variety of sources
- Create a library of global identifiers for events, places, persons, organizations and works in the Canadian arts sector
- Link to other knowledge sources like Wikidata; leverage the use of existing global identifiers and linked open data with the goal of creating a substantial web of data
